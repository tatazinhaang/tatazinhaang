I have a degree in Administration and Systems Analysis and Development. I'm in the second period of Computer Engineering. I have studied programming for just over 1 year, with experience in Front End Development, using the following technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Vue.js and React. I am currently studying in the back end area using Java, and I started studying in the information security area.
